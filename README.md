# Astronomy-X-Machine-Learning-Research-Project
Presenting a Multidisciplinary Research Project on Astronomy and Machine Learning. In this research, multiple ML models were trained to check if they can identify Potentially Habitable Exoplanets in NASA and PHL datasets. Notably, the Candidates are already discussed in the scientific community, which increases confidence in the model’s ranking.
